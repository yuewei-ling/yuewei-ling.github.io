[**Severity indices of diquat poisoning for triage and prognosis in acute diquat poisoning: a multi-center prospective cohort study**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2025.02.022) | 2025<br/>
**Ling Y<sup>#</sup>**, Mao Z<sup>#</sup>, Liu W<sup>#</sup>, Zhou C, Li J, Jiang L, Li M, Zhao H, Nie S, Wu C, Chen J, Bai G, Ren G, Xu J, Chen F, Zhang J, Sun H
- This study developed and validated severity indices for diquat poisoning (SIDPs) that enable emergency physicians to assess mortality risk for triage and 28-day prognosis using self-reported clinical data and laboratory biomarkers.
- This multicenter cohort study involved 204 patients. Predictors identified by the Burota algorithm and stepwise Cox regression were incorporated into Cox proportional hazards models to develop SIDPs, one for triage and one for prognosis (SIDP-T and SIDP-P, respectively).
- We launched a user-friendly [**online platform**](https://severityindexofdiquatpoisoning.streamlit.app/) that enables emergency physicians to apply severity indices directly at the point of care.

[**Impact of an enhanced recovery after surgery program integrating cardiopulmonary rehabilitation on post-operative prognosis of patients treated with CABG: protocol of the ERAS-CaRe randomized controlled trial**](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-024-03286-1) | 2024<br/>

- This protocol designed a pragmatic, randomized-controlled, parallel four-arm, clinical trial to evaluate possible superiority of embedding cardiopulmonary rehabilitation in enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) over ERAS alone as well as to investigate effects of differential timing of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation within enhanced recovery after surgery (pre-, post-, perio-operative) on post-operative cardiopulmonary complications following coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.

Chen S<sup>#</sup>, **Ling Y<sup>#</sup>**, Zhou F, Qiao X, Reinhardt JD
- This study found three cognitive trajectories among Chinese adults aged 45 and older with diabetes using data from the nationally representative China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). 
- We employed a growth mixture model to identify cognitive trajectories, and examined baseline risk factors using weighted multinomial logistic regression.
