# ðŸ‘‹About Me

I am a second-year PhD student in Management Science and Engineering (MS&E) at Stanford University, where I am advised by Professor **[Margaret Brandeau](https://profiles.stanford.edu/margaret-brandeau)** and Professor **[Marissa Reitsma](https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/people/marissa-reitsma)**. My research focuses on health policy modeling and medical decision-making. Currently, I am developing data-driven frameworks that inform policy responses to the opioid crisis among people experiencing homelessness.
